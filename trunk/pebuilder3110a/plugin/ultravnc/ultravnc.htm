<i>PE Builder v3 plugin</i>
<hr>
<h1>UltraVNC</h1>
<a target="_blank" href="http://ultravnc.sourceforge.net/">UltraVNC</a>
(GNU-GPL) is a free remote control package derived from the popular VNC 
software. With UltraVNC, you can see the desktop of a remote machine 
and control it with your local mouse and keyboard, just like you would 
do it sitting in the front of that computer.<br>
<br>
Before you can use the plugin you must download the 
program and copy it to the plugin directory.<br>
<br>
Download the latest version of <a target="_blank" href="http://ultravnc.sourceforge.net/download.htm">Ultr@VNC Binaries Zip</a> (at this time v1.0.0 RC18).<br>
Extract all files from the downloaded file into the <tt>plugin\ultravnc\files</tt> directory.<br>
Or you can get the latest version and install it on your workstation and 
copy files from <tt>c:\program files\ultravnc</tt><br>
<br>
The default VNC password is set to &quot;bartpevnc&quot;.<br>
<br>
