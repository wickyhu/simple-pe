        <h1>HWPnP Plugin</h1>
        <p>This plugin is used to detect and install devices which currently have no driver 
            installed. By default it will install devices with device ids that start with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            PCI\VEN
            <li>
            ACPI_HAL\
            <li>
            ACPI\
            <li>
            IDE\
            <li>
            PCIIDE\
            <li>
            ISAPNP\
            <li>
            LPTENUM\
            <li>
            ROOT\ACPI
            <li>
            ROOT\DMIO
            <li>
            ROOT\SYSTEM
            <LI>
            SERENUM\
            <li>
            STORAGE\
            <li>
            SW\
            <li>
            USB\
            <li>
                USBSTOR\</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the installation of a device results in the popup of the <strong>'Found New 
                Device'</strong> dialog then the <strong>&lt;next&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;finish&gt;</strong>
            buttons will automatically be clicked so that no user intervention is required 
            for device detection to continue. The buttons are identified in the dialog by 
            looking for controls with particular control ids so hopefully this will work in 
            all languages. Its only been tested in US english.</p>
        <P>Note that under XP you can find the device ids of installed devices by setting 
            the environment variable <strong>DEVMGR_SHOW_DETAILS=1</strong>. Then In Device 
            Manager the properties for a device should now provide a <STRONG>Details</STRONG>
            tab that contains additional information about the device. Another way to 
            obtain the current device ids from XP is to run the HWPnP program but specify 
            the following parameters:</P>
        <p>HWPnP -all /logcon</p>
        <P>The program is called as follows:</P>
        <pre><strong>
HWPnP {+all|-all}
      {+&lt;DeviceID_0&gt;|+&lt;@Class_0&gt;|-&lt;DeviceID_0&gt;|-&lt;@Class_0&gt;|=&lt;DeviceID_0&gt;|=&lt;@Class_0&gt;} ... 
      {+&lt;DeviceID_N&gt;|+&lt;@Class_N&gt;|-&lt;DeviceID_0&gt;|-&lt;@Class_N&gt;|=&lt;DeviceID_0&gt;|=&lt;@Class_N&gt;} ... 
      {/a}
      {/cid}
      {/d|/d+}
      {/h}
      {/hid}
      {/log|/log+|/logcon}
      {/p}
      {/r}
      {/s}
      {/u}	
      </strong></pre>
        <P>If <STRONG>+all</STRONG> is specified then all devices, which currently do not 
            have a device driver loaded and for which a device driver is available, will 
            have an attempt made&nbsp;to load the&nbsp;driver.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<STRONG>-all</STRONG> is specified then all built in device id strings 
            will be removed and only devices which match device ids specified in program 
            parameters will have their device drivers loaded. If this parameter is used 
            then it should preceed any explicit device id parameters.</P>
        <P>
            The &nbsp;<strong>&lt;DeviceID_N&gt;</strong> can be the device id or part of 
            the device ID e.g. ROOT\DMIO.</P>
        <P>
            The <b>&lt;@Class_N&gt; </b>is the name of a device class e.g. NET.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<strong>+&lt;DeviceID_N&gt;</strong> is specified then any 
            device&nbsp;with a device id that starts with the specified string&nbsp;will be 
            attempted to have its device driver loaded. The device driver will only be 
            attempted to be loaded if the device status reports that the device is not 
            currenty running.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<strong>+&lt;@Class_N&gt;</strong> is specified then any 
            device&nbsp;with a device class that is equal to the specified string&nbsp;will 
            be attempted to have its device driver loaded. The device driver will only be 
            attempted to be loaded if the device status reports that the device is not 
            currenty running.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<strong>=&lt;DeviceID_N&gt;</strong> is specified then any device with 
            a device id that starts with the specified string will be attempted to have its 
            device driver loaded regardless of the current status of the device.This option 
            should be used carefully as most of the system devices require a reboot ( which 
            obviously in PE will not work ) to start the device driver and in some cause a 
            machine lockup if any attempt is made&nbsp;to start them.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<strong>=&lt;@Class_N&gt;</strong> is specified then any device with a 
            device class that is equal to the specified string will be attempted to have 
            its device driver loaded regardless of the current status of the device.This 
            option should be used carefully as most of the system devices require a reboot 
            ( which obviously in PE will not work ) to start the device driver and in some 
            cause a machine lockup if any attempt is made&nbsp;to start them.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<strong>-&lt;DeviceID_N&gt;</strong> is specified then any device with 
            a device id that starts with the specified string is excluded from the list of 
            devices which may have their device driver loaded. Usually this will be used in 
            conjunction with the +all option but it may also be used to eliminate some of 
            the built in device id&nbsp;prefixes.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<strong>-&lt;@Class_N&gt;</strong> is specified then any device with a 
            device class that is equal to the specified string is excluded from the list of 
            devices which may have their device driver loaded. Usually this will be used in 
            conjunction with the +all option.</P>
        <P>So for example if you wanted to disable installation of device ids that started 
            with ROOT\ACPI or ROOT\DMIO and you wanted to add installation of device ids 
            that start with ROOT\MEDIA you would call the program&nbsp;by:</P>
        <P><strong>HWPnP -ROOT\ACPI -ROOT\DMIO +ROOT\MEDIA</strong></P>
        <P>If you wanted to install all devices except devices of class NET then you would 
            call the program by:</P>
        <P><b>HWPnP +all -@NET</b></P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<strong>/log</strong> is specified then the diagnostic trace 
            information will be logged to %ramdrv%\HWPnP.log.</P>
		<P>If &nbsp;<strong>/log+</strong> is specified then the diagnostic trace 
            information will be appended to %ramdrv%\HWPnP.log.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<strong>/logcon</strong> is specified then the diagnostic tracing will 
            be logged to a new console. When the hardware scan finishes the program will 
            wait for user input before closing the console.</P>
        <P>If&nbsp; <b>/a</b> is specified then the devices will be rescanned until no new 
            devices are installed. I use the following command for installing new USB 
            storage devices:</P>
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>HWPnP.exe -all /log /p +STORAGE\VOLUME +USB\ +USBSTOR\ /a /u</b></P>
        <P>If <strong>/cid</strong> is specified then compatible device 
		identifiers for a device will be scanned when searching for a device id 
		match.</P>
		<P>If &nbsp;<strong>/d</strong> is specified then driver signing will be disabled.</P>
		<P>If &nbsp;<strong>/d+</strong> is specified then driver signing will 
		be disabled after installing first device. The registry settings are 
		ignored unless made after installing one device. If the network is 
		installed prior to running HWPnP then <b>/d</b> should work.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<strong>/h</strong> is specified then any "Found New Device" dialogs 
            that appear will be hidden ( they will very briefly appear ).</P>
		<P>If <strong>/hid</strong> is specified then all device identifiers for 
		a device will be scanned when searching for a device id match.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<b>/p</b> is specified then a progress dialog box will be displayed 
            which is very similar to the one displayed by the Sherpya AutoRamResizer 
            program. It will show the device id of devices as they are enumerated.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<b>/u</b> is specified then any 'unknown devices' will have an attempt 
            made to load a device driver. This option should be used with care - a lock up 
            may result. Note that some of the devices require a reboot to become fully 
            operational ( of course in the context of PE this will have no effect).</P>
        <P>If <b>&nbsp;/r </b>is specified then the SystemSetupInProgress registry flag 
            will be cleared before performing the plug and play detection scan. If will be 
            reset back to 1 after the scan is performed.</P>
        <P>If &nbsp;<b>/s </b>is specified then setupapi logging to the ram drive will be 
            enabled prior to hardware detection.</P>
        <P>Note the load of network adaptors will fail unless netcfgx.dll is registered 
            first with regsvr32.</P>
