<i>PE Builder v3 plugin</i>
<hr>
<h1>Nu2Menu</h1>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nu2.nu/nu2menu/">Nu2Menu</a>
is a highly dynamic shell/menu application designed for Windows 2000/XP/PE.
It was specially created for PE-Builder.
You can also use it as an (autorun) cd menu that uses the same menu file when 
booting from windows PE. This is the way PE Builder uses it...<br>
<br>
All files to use Nu2Menu are included with PE Builder.<br>
<br>

<br>
To use a different &quot;GO&quot; button image, just add a file called <tt>nu2go.bmp</tt> into 
the <tt>plugin\nu2menu</tt> directory.
PE Builder will automatically copy it when found.<br>
