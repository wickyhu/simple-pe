<h1>Searching Windows installation files</h1>
<br>
This dialog will search all drives (of the type: fixed, CD-Rom or removable) and 
all directories for valid windows installation files.<br>
<b>Depending on how much files are on your system, this can take a while!</b><br>
<br>
When more than one valid location is found, a dialog will appear where you can 
select which location you want to use.<br>
