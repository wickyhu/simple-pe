<h1>Slipstream service pack</h1>
This dialog helps you slipstream your Microsoft Windows installation files 
with the latest service pack from Microsoft.<br>
<br>
Enter the source (do not include the i386 directory)!<br>
If your installation files are located on a CD or DVD make sure that you enable 
the &quot;source is readonly&quot; checkbox. This way all files are being 
copied to the location specified by &quot;output&quot; and that will be 
slipstreamed.<br>
<br>
When service pack installation is running the pebuilder application does not respond!
Just wait for the service pack update program to complete...<br>
