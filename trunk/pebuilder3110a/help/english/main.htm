<h1>Main dialog screen</h1>
<br>
<h2>Source path</h2>
Drive letter to CD or local/remote path containing the &quot;source&quot; files.
The source files must be one of the following versions of Windows:<br>
<ul>
<li>Windows XP Home Edition (must be Service Pack 1 or higher)</li>
<li>Windows XP Professional (must be Service Pack 1 or higher)</li>
<li>Windows Server 2003, Web Edition</li>
<li>Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition</li>
<li>Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition</li>
</ul>
<br>
If your PC comes with Windows XP preinstalled on the harddisk and your
vendor supplies CD/DVD media that will restore the system back into the 
factory/preinstalled state you may not have a Windows XP installation CD.<br>
However, there is a big change that the Windows installation files are somewhere 
on your harddisk. Try searching for Windows installation files using the
<a href="search.htm">Source/Search</a> menu option.<br>
<br>
<h2>Custom directory</h2>
Select a local or remote path containing any folders and files you want to add/include.<br>
Don't include your windows directory, or any other folder that has file that are in use.
Also keep in mind that the files added must fix your target media.
For example when creating a bootable CD-Rom you can add something around 300-400MB of extra data.<br>
If you unsure what enter in this fields, then leave it empty!<br>
<br>
<h2>Output directory</h2>
Enter a directory name to &quot;store&quot; the files PE Builder copies for you.
Please note that the location your enter is relative to your pebuilder directory.<br>
If you need to specify an absolute path, you must change the &quot;output path 
absolute&quot; in the <a href="options.htm">Options dialog</a>.
<br>
<h2>Media output</h2>
When you specify &quot;None&quot; the builder will only output the files to your 
output location and take no further action.<br>
If you want to create an ISO image you must select &quot;Create ISO image&quot; 
and you must check that a valid filename is entered in the textbox below.<br>
The builder can also burn a CD or DVD media for you if you select &quot;Burn to CD/DVD&quot;.
If you burn using &quot;cdrecord&quot; you can only burn a CD (not a DVD).
Burning to a DVD writer is only supported when burning using starburn!<br>
