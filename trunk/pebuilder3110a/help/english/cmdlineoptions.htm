<h1>Command line options</h1>
PE Builder accepts the following command line arguments:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>-auto</td><td>Automatically start building</td></tr>
<tr><td>-exit</td><td>Automatically exit program after building.
When there are errors during building pebuilder does not exit!</td></tr>
<tr><td>-overwrite</td><td>Automatically overwrite target folder (does not ask for confirmation)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-verbose</td><td>Set verbose mode on, pebuilder will talk more</td></tr>
<tr><td>-skipregistry</td><td>Skip building the registry files</td></tr>
<tr><td>-skipfiles</td><td>Skip building the files, handy when you are testing changes that only reflect registry</td></tr>
<tr><td>-buildiso</td><td>Build the ISO image, simply rebuild the ISO image from the output path (also burns CD/DVD when required)</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
PE Builder returns the number of errors while building as the errorlevel.<br>
<br>
If you want to automate building BartPE you can use the following example:
<pre>
pebuilder.exe -auto -overwrite -exit
if errorlevel 1 echo *** Something was wrong ***
</pre><br>
